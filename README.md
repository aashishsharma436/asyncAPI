# Spring Boot Reactive Rest API with R2DBC and WebFlux
This project demonstrates a reactive Spring Boot application using R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity) for non-blocking database access and Spring WebFlux for building reactive, high-performance web productRepositoryImpl.

## Technologies
1. Spring Boot: Simplifies setup and configuration for production-ready applications.
2. Spring WebFlux: Provides a fully non-blocking, reactive framework for building REST APIs.
3. R2DBC: Allows asynchronous, reactive database operations with relational databases.

## Prerequisites
1. Java 21 or later
2. Maven
3. A supported R2DBC relational database
